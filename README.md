# My weekly planner

This is a tool I created, inspired from the 5-minute journal and the productivity planner from Intelligent Change (Mimi and Alex Ikonn), adapted to my personal needs.
It is designed to organize my tasks and my goals on a weekly and daily basis, and has a journaling section for positivity and gratitude.

Goals :
- Be able to personally use it, so it has to be fully functional.
- Integrate it inside a website that has all my information, maybe a link to my youtube channel, a few pictures, mayble a blog section for my research, etc. Basically it would be a place for all my creativity.
